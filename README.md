This is my first React App and was one of my homework assignments in the GW Coding Bootcamp.

This App contains  a game where you can only click on any image once and if you click on an image more than once then the game is over. After each click the images shuffle.

While I wasn't able to have all of the functions working several of them do work. The app is made in React so it's made up of a Class component and two functional components children and grandchildren.

Passing functions as props two levels down was one of the tricky parts in coding this app but it helped me a great deal with wrapping my head around React.
